[Chorus]
Tell me, is she still up? (Up)
It’s five AM and I’m drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck?
One of one, I’m in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? Mm
Tellin’ you just how I feel right now
You say it’s just the drugs, and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lied too, way before, before
Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I can be drunk (It’s lit, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don’t wanna sound righteous (Yeah)
I got twenty bitches suckin’ like bisons
I just eeny, meeny, miney, roll the dices, I pick her (Pop it, pop it)
She ain’t really even my type, been out here
She been losin’ herself to the night shift
She been losin’ herself, and I get it, oh, girl, yeah, I get it
Yeah, yeah, you’ve been fightin’ for your shot
And you’ve been searchin’ for your spot
Girl, I feel it, yeah, girl, I feel it, yeah
But you think you got your groove
But you want someone like you (Let’s go)

[Chorus]
Tell me, is she still up? (Up)
It’s five AM and I’m drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck?
One of one, I’m in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? Mm
Tellin’ you just how I feel right now
You say it’s just the drugs, and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (Ooh, it’s the kid, louder)
I lied too, way before, before (How they feelin’, how they feelin’, Ooh)
Before I had you right inside my arms (Feelin’ like some money, tonight)
But then again, I can be drunk (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I know, mami, I know (Know), it’s two AM, don’t stress
Two-three, that blue shit kickin’, and thirty, I feel you best
I turned my whole spot to crucial, it’s crucial, the way I left (Lit)
Upstairs is like a low, I love, it just be the best (Let’s go)
I’m lookin’ at her, rehearsin’ what I’m tellin’ to you (Her)
Now you startin’ to fuck up my mind, is it you, is it her?
We brought booby check to the ‘burbs
F29 is my address, in case you ain’t heard
It’s flooded upstairs, it’s a leak
I don’t make squeak, make it squeak
I make this shit beat, bon appetit when I feast
Slippin’ and slide through the streets, it takes a finesse
Especially in this Cabriolet Jeep, engine make chaotic creep
She leave the gate open, through the side door, I’ma creep (Ooh, ooh)
Are you ’bout it? Too real, and are the kids downstairs asleep?
And are you upstairs by yourself? A minute from there
Is there some room for me? Baby, do tell, do tell

[Chorus]
Tell me, is she still up? (Up)
It’s five AM and I’m drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Drop that shit)
One of one, I’m in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? Mm
Tellin’ you just how I feel right now
You say it’s just the drugs, and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lied too, way before (Let’s go), before
Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I can be drunk
